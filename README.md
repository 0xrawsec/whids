# WHIDS

Very flexible Host IDS designed for Windows. We are making
use of a previously developped rule engine [Gene](https://github.com/0xrawsec/gene)
designed to match Windows events according to custom rules. The
rules are simple to write and easy to understand so that everyone can
identify why a rule has triggered.

With the democratisation of Sysmon, this tools is perfect to quickly build
hunting rules or simply monitoring rules to screen things of interest happening on your
machine(s). With WHIDS you don't have to bother with an over
complicated Sysmon configuration which often turns to the nightmare when you want
to be very specific.The simplest thing is just to enable all the logging
capabilites of Sysmon and let WHIDS do his job, grab a coffee and wait
for the juicy stuff to happen. The tool has a low overhead for the system,
according to our current benchmarks.

This tool can be used on any Windows machine so you might install it either on
regular workstations or on Windows Event Collectors where you are receiving
all the logs of your infrastructure. The output format is nothing else than
JSON so it is very easy to handle the alerts generated by the HIDS in whatever
tool you want to use for this purpose like ELK, Splunk or simply your favourite
SIEM.

# Example

Here is an example of a rule designed to catch suspicious access to *lsass.exe*
as it is done by the well known Mimikatz credential dump tool.

```json
{
  "Name": "MaliciousLsassAccess",
  "Tags": ["Mimikatz", "Credentials", "Lsass"],
  "Meta": {
    "EventIDs": [10],
    "Channels": ["Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"],
    "Computers": [],
    "Traces": [],
    "Criticality": 10,
    "Author": "0xrawsec"
  },
  "Matches": [
    "$ct: CallTrace ~= 'UNKNOWN'",
    "$lsass: TargetImage ~= '(?i:\\\\lsass\\.exe$)'"
  ],
  "Condition": "$lsass and $ct"
}
```

You can find a bunch of other rules as well as a quick introduction to the
syntax of the rules on the [Gene repository](https://github.com/0xrawsec/gene-rules).

# Demo

Running WHIDS with an already running Powershell Empire agent which invokes
Mimikatz module.

![WHIDS Mimikatz Demo](https://github.com/0xrawsec/whids/blob/master/demo/whids.gif)

Herafter is the kind of output returned by WHIDS. An additional section is added to the
JSON event where the criticality of the alert is reported along with the different signatures
which matched the event.

```json
{
  "Event": {
    "EventData": {
      "CallTrace": "C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+4bf9a|C:\\Windows\\system32\\KERNELBASE.dll+189b7|UNKNOWN(00000000259123BC)",
      "GrantedAccess": "0x1410",
      "SourceImage": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
      "SourceProcessGUID": "{49F1AF32-DD18-5A72-0000-0010042C0A00}",
      "SourceProcessId": "2248",
      "SourceThreadId": "3308",
      "TargetImage": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\lsass.exe",
      "TargetProcessGUID": "{49F1AF32-DB3B-5A72-0000-001013690000}",
      "TargetProcessId": "492",
      "UtcTime": "2018-02-01 11:24:53.331"
    },
    "GeneInfo": {
      "Criticality": 10,
      "Signature": [
        "MaliciousLsassAccess"
      ]
    },
    "System": {
        "Classical Windows Event System Section": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

# Installation

## WHIDS
1. Run `install.bat` as administrator
2. Verify that files have been created at the **installation directory**
3. With a text editor **opened as administrator** open `config.json` and modify it as you wish
4. Skip this if running with a connection to a manager. If there is nothing in the **rules directory** the tool will be useless, so make sure there are some **gene** rules in there. You can get some compiled rules [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xrawsec/gene-rules/master/compiled.gen)
5. Start the HIDS with `Start.bat` script located in **installation directory**
6. If you configured a **manager** do not forget to run it

NB: whenever you go to the installation directory with **File Explorer** and if you are **Administrator** the explorer will ask you if you want to change the permission of the directory. **DO NOT CLICK YES**, otherwise it will break the folder permissions put in place at installation time. Always access installation directory from **applications started as Administrator**.

# Known Issues

* Does not work properly when ran from a network share **mapped as a network drive** (this case prevent whids to identify itself and thus generate some noise). Example: if `\\vbox\test` is mounted as `Z:` drive, running `Z:\whids.exe` **won't work** while running `\\vbox\test\whids.exe` actually would.

# Changelog

## v1.4
  * Dump hooks
    * dump file: dump as many relevant files as possible when an alert above threshold is raised
      * dump anything which is a file and that appears in Sysmon fields, depending on the event
      * can dump ADS
      * can dump scripts
      * can dump executables
    * dump memory: creates a **MS full minidump** of a process that triggers an alert above threshold
  * Process integrity hook
    * Two fields are added to the Sysmon **CreateProcess** events **ProcessIntegrity** and **ParentProcessIntegrity**. If value is **-1** it means process integrity could not be 
    computed. Otherwise it is a float value in **[0;100]** measuring the degree of similarity between the image loaded in memory and the image on the disk. The **higher** the value is, the more likely the process image **has been modified**.
  * Builtin alert forwarder
    * New command line utility **whids-man** aiming at collecting the logs and being deployed on a remote machine (**windows, linux, macos ...**)
      * HTTP / HTTPS are supported (HTTPS is preferred)
      * Builtin cert and key generation (convenient for testing but better with OpenSSL for prod)
      * Client authentication via API key to forward the logs
      * Server authentication can be enforced on client side via authentication key
      * Alerts are dumped in a GZIP file automatically rotated when **100MB** size is reached
    * New command line switch **-forward** to configure forwarding on Host side
      * if manager is offline, we store the alerts in a local queue and upload them when the manager comes up again
      * builtin queue file rotation
      * builtin queued files cleaning if disk space is too high
  * Install script has been updated
    * Protects the installation directory to be accessible / modifiable only by users member of Administrators group or SYSTEM user
    * The scheduled tasks now starts **whids-launcher.bat** located in installation directory, instead of starting WHIDS directly. This way it is easier to modify the command line arguments.
  * Project tree has a bit changed, **main** code has been moved to **tools** directory
      
## v1.3
  * **Event Hook** introduction
    * Can modify the events before going through detection engine
    * Created hooks to overcome domain name resolution issue
    * Implemented hooks to enrich Sysmon events 1, 6 and 7 with the size of the PE image
    * Implemented several other hooks
  * Can run in **service mode**:
    * restart in case of failure
    * log alerts to compressed file and rotate file automatically
    * log messages to a file
  * Installation script
    * creates a scheduled start running at boot to start Whids
    * agenerate an uninstall script dropped in the install folder
  * Number of new command lines arguments
    * **-hooks**: control event hook activation
    * **-protect**: dummy protection against crypto-locker (can be seen as a nice POC of event hooks)
    * **-all**: option to enable logging of **all** the events coming from the monitored channels
    should not be used in production, it is more for debugging purposes
    * ...
  * Some minor code refactoring

## v1.2
  * Log to Windows Application channel
  * Updated with latest version of gene so it benefits of its new features
    * "Match extracts" feature to match parts of event fields against containers (blacklist/whitelist)
  * New channel Alias to Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client/Operational
  * Command line switch to enable DNS client logs (Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client/Operational log channel)
